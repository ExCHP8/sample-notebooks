**Entity extraction on Financial Complaints with Watson NLP**

This notebook demonstrates how to extract named entities from financial customer complaints using Watson NLP.

**Financial complaint analysis**

This notebook demonstrates how to analyze financial customer complaints using Watson NLP.

**Car complaint analysis**

This notebook demonstrates how to analyze car complaints using Watson NLP.

**Use AutoAI and Lale to predict credit risk with IBM WML**

Learn how to use AutoAI experiments in this notebook by getting a German credit data set and train the model to predict banking credit. 

**Complaint classification with Watson NLP**

This notebook demonstrates how to train different text classifiers using Watson NLP. The classifiers predict the product group from the text of a customer complaint. This could be used, for example to route a complaint to the appropriate staff member.
