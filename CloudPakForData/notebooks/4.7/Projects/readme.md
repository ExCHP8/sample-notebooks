## Natural Language Processing Sample Project

This project contains samples that demonstrate the capabilities of the Watson NLP service, including analyzing sentiments from hotel review comments.

## Creating and using feature store data

In this project, you will find examples on how to create and use feature groups in notebooks. Feature groups are data assets that contain additional metadata for machine learning tasks. By publishing Feature Group data assets to a Catalog, you can turn your Catalog into a Feature Store that makes it easy for Data Scientists to find curated data assets for machine learning.
