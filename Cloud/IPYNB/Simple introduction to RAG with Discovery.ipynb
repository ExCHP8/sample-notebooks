This notebook uses Python 3.10.\n\n\n## Learning goal\n\nThe goal of this notebook is to demonstrate how to apply the retrieval-augmented generation pattern to a question-answering use case in watsonx.ai.\n\n\n## Scenario\nThe website for an online seed catalog has many articles to help customers plan their garden and ultimately select which seeds to purchase. A new widget is being added to the website to answer customer questions based on the contents of the article the customer is viewing. Given a question related to a given article, answer the question based on the article.\n\n\n## Contents\n\nThis notebook contains the following parts:\n\n- [Overview of retrieval-augmented generation](#overview)\n- [Step 1: Set up prerequisites](#setup)\n- [Step 2: Create a knowledge base in Watson Discovery](#discovery)\n- [Step 3: Define a search function that calls Discovery](#search)\n- [Step 4: Craft prompt text](#prompt)\n- [Step 5: Generate output using the foundation models Python library](#generate)\n- [Step 6: Pull everything together to perform retrieval-augmented generation](#rag)\n- [Summary](#summary)"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "<a id=\"overview\"></a>\n## Overview of retrieval-augmented generation\n\nThe retrieval-augmented generation pattern involves three basic steps:\n1. Search for relevant content in your knowledge base\n2. Pull the most relevant content into your prompt as context\n3. Send the combined prompt text to a foundation model to generate output\n\nThe term _retrieval-augmented generation_ (RAG) was introduced in this paper: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener no referrer\">Retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks</a>\n\n> \"We build RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq transformer, and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever.\"\n\nIn that paper, the term \"RAG models\" refers to a specific implementation of a _retriever_ (a specific query encoder and vector-based document search index) and a _generator_ (a specific pre-trained, generative language model.) \n\nHowever, the basic search-and-generate approach can be generalized to use different retriever components and foundation models.\n\nIn this notebook:\n- The **knowledge base** is a list of two articles\n- The **retrieval component** consists of a Watson Discovery collection\n- The **generate** component uses the foundation model Python library in watsonx.ai\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "<a
