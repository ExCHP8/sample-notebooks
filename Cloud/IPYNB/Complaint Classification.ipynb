The classifiers predict the product group from the text of a customer complaint. This could be used, for example to route a complaint to the appropriate staff member. \n","\n","The data that is used in this notebook is taken from the Consumer Complaint Database that is published by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a U.S. government agency. The Consumer Complaint Database is a collection of complaints about consumer financial products and services that the CFPB sent to companies for response.  A complaint contains the consumerâ€™s narrative description of their experience if the consumer opted to share this information publicly and after the Bureau has removed all personal information. In this notebook, you will focus on complaints that contain this narrative description to show how to use Watson NLP.\n","\n","The data is publicly available at https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/.\n","\n","## What you'll learn in this notebook\n","\n","Watson NLP implements state-of-the-art classification algorithms from three different families: \n","- Classic machine learning using SVM (Support Vector Machines)\n","- Deep learning using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)\n","- Transformer-based models based on the pretrained Slate IBM Foundation model\n","\n","Watson NLP also offers an easy to use _ensemble classifier_ which combines different classification algorithms and a majority voting.\n","\n","In this notebook, you'll learn how to:\n","\n","- **Prepare your data** so that it can be used as training data for the Watson NLP classification algorithms.\n","- **Train a custom SVM model** using `watson_nlp.blocks.classification.SVM`. SVM stands for Support Vector Machines. It's an established classification method. We will run it based on USE (Universal Sentence Encoder) embeddings of the input text.\n","- **Train a VotingEnsemble** using `watson_nlp.workflows.classification.GenericEnsemble`. Generic Ensemble allows to use any combination of the three base classifierts CNN, SVM with TF-IDF and SVM with USE (Universal Sentence Encoder). It computes the weighted mean of classification predictions using confidence scores.\n","- **Store and load classification models** as an asset of a Watson Studio project.\n","- **Score data and compare model quality** by running the models on test data and using the built-in quality evaluation and building a custom confusion matrix.\n","\n","\n","## Table of Contents\n","\n","\n","1.
