The notebook uses the spatio-temporal library that is pre-installed on all Spark environments in Watson Studio. You will learn how to perform common spatial queries in Spark. \n\nThe types of spatial queries you will learn to use are:\n- In a set of points, find all the points that are within a certain distance to a particular point. For example, find all the hospitals that are within a certain distance to a given location.\n- In a set of polygons, find all the polygons that contain a particular point. For example, find all the risk areas for fires, floods, or hurricanes that contain a particular location.\n- In a set of points, find all the points that are contained within a particular polygon. For example, find all the retail outlets in a particular region.\n\nOften, a spatial function has one parameter that refers to a spatial column in one table and a second parameter that refers to a spatial constant or to a spatial column in another table. This notebook shows you how to use functions to access and combine data of different types to perform spatial queries.\n\nThis notebook runs on Python and Spark.\n\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n\n1.

Code that adds a Spark data frame will be generated automatically.\n- If your data is hosted in a designated bucket, you can use `ibmos2spark` to read the data into a Spark data frame.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Read the hospital data where each hospital's location is a latitude-longitude point:"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "import pandas as pd\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import *", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "from urllib.request import Request, urlopen\n    \nreq = Request('https://api.dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/v2/gallery-assets/entries/5562ced564e776edc5f91e13d48d8309/data?accessKey=466875ad0187d4ea757478e5c1130b59')\nreq.add_header('User-Agent', 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:77.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/77.0')\ncontent = urlopen(req)\n\nhospital_pdf = pd.read_csv(content)\nprint(hospital_pdf)", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "If you run into an error running the above code due to link not found, please download the `hospitals.csv` data set in the Watson Studio gallery and insert it manually using the method given above."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "hospital_schema = StructType([StructField('id', IntegerType()),\n                              StructField('name', StringType()),\n                              StructField('city', StringType()),\n                              StructField('state', StringType()),\n                              StructField('lon', DoubleType()),\n                              StructField('lat', DoubleType())])", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "hospital_df = spark.createDataFrame(hospital_pdf, hospital_schema)", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "hospital_df.show(3)", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Read the county data where each county is a polygon/multipolygon:"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "from urllib.request import Request, urlopen  # Python 3\n    \nreq = Request('https://api.dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/v2/gallery-assets/entries/c8cc28f4c30dc4d8c0b13f18c50c3244/data?accessKey=c8cc28f4c30dc4d8c0b13f18c50fa2d5')\nreq.add_header('User-Agent', 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:77.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/77.0')\ncontent = urlopen(req)\n\ncounties_pdf = pd.read_csv(content)[['NAME', 'STATE_NAME', 'POP2000', 'shape_WKT']]\nprint(counties_pdf)", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "counties_schema = StructType([StructField('NAME', StringType()),\n                              StructField('STATE_NAME', StringType()),\n                              StructField('POP2000', IntegerType()),\n                              StructField('shape_WKT', StringType())])", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "counties_df = spark.createDataFrame(counties_pdf, counties_schema)", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "counties_df.show(3)", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "<a id=\"createColumn\"></a>\n## 3.
