While the LLM cannot memorize the prompts and the context thereof, it can generate responses off the context which can bring an element of risk. In this notebook, we will show how this potential threat can play out and demonstrate how to shield your applications from it.  \n","\n","This notebook shows how IBM Cloud Security & Compliance Center Data Security Broker (DSB or SCC DSB) can be used to dynamically encrypt/mask sensitive data that is fed into an LLM in a typical Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow. We will demonstrate this with an example showing a couple of personas - a privileged user and a non-privileged user - and how the responses generated by LLM can be altered by dynamic RBAC and data masking without any changes to your Gen AI application!\n","\n","For this demo, we will be using the IBM watsonx platform and one of the available LLMs - it should work with any of the available decoder models.\n","\n","You can learn more about Data Security Broker in its [product documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-broker)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Table of Contents\n","\n","This notebook contains the following parts:\n","\n","1.\t[Intro to basic concepts](#rag)\n","1.\t[Prerequisites](#prereq)\n","1.\t[Setup](#steps)\n","1.\t[Persona 1: pass context to the LLM as a Nurse](#persona1)\n","1.

This reduces the chances that an LLM will leak sensitive data, or ‘hallucinate’ incorrect or misleading information.\n","-\tUsers don’t need to continuously train the model on new data and update its parameters as circumstances evolve. In this way, RAG can lower the computational and financial costs of running LLM-powered chatbots in an enterprise setting.\n","\n","\n","You can learn more about RAG from this [source document](https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["\n","### Application-Level Encryption\n","\n","Application-level encryption (ALE) is an approach to data protection that encrypts data at its source before it is stored or transmitted to other layers of the systems. Typical data/access controls tend to be over the perimter, but ALE shrinks them down to the data itself. This means that all the other layers are already secure by default, which improves the application's general risk profile.\n","\n","Since DSB is the reverse-proxy based ALE solution, you can deploy DSB Shield in your data pipelines/paths and dynamically encrypt/mask data based on your role based access controls. \n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<a id=\"prereq\"></a>\n","## Prerequisites\n","\n","Prepare the database you will be working with.
