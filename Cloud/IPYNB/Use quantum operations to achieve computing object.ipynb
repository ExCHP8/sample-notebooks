    "The purpose of this notebook article is to demonstrate using quantum operations to achieve computing objectives. The term *quantum operation* refers to a higher level method that may be implemented with one or many low-level quantum gates.  More generally, the goal is to demonstrate the notion that quantum algorithms use quantum operations to implement constraints that coerce qubits from representing any possible outcomes to representing the outcomes that satisfy the constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using John Preskill's terminology, we now have \"noisy intermediate scale quantum\" (NISQ) computers that can obtain a desired outcome with high probablility, i.e. where the desired outcome rises well above the noise that can occur within the current early-stage quantum computing devices. In this notebook article, we will implement a classical computing algorithm in order to see how differently it is done in quantum computing, and we will see that the desired outcome occurs by far the most frequently.  However, note that the emphasis is on understanding how the quantum operations achieve an easily understood result, and so there is no quantum computing speedup in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook article, we will create a **quantum circuit** that uses quantum operations to perform **addition** of two single bit numbers. This problem reduces to developing quantum operation sequences that perform a classical 'XOR' operation to calculate the least significant bit and a classical 'AND' operation to calculate the most significant bit of the answer. This can be seen in the two columns of the expected answers below:\n",

    "In this notebook, we have demonstrated how quantum algorithms use quantum operations to coerce qubits into representing the outcome or outcomes that satisfy the constraints of a problem. In the case of quantum addition of two qubits initialized with classical bit values, one output qubit had to satisfy the constraint of being excited if and only if the two input qubits differed, and a second output qubit had to satisfy the constraint of being excited if and only if both input qubits were excited. Not only did we simulate this quantum circuit, we ran it on a real IBM Q quantum computer. When we did, we witnessed the fact that in the NISQ era, one plus one is most probably two!\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, note that the quantum logical AND method we built above is also signicant because one can append an X gate, which performs a logical NOT, resulting in a NAND operation. In classical cmputing, the NAND operation is a universal gate that can be used to build all other classical computing circuits. **Therefore, any classical computing solution can be expressed... and we have only used 4 points of the Bloch sphere representing the total expressive power available to each qubit of a quantum computer.**"
