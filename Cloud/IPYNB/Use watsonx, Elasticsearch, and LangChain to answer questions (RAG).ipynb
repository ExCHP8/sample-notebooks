    "- Index knowledge base passages (once)\n",

Ottoman massacre of Greek irregulars in Bucharest ( August , 1821 ) In 1862 , after Wallachia and Moldavia were united to form the Principality of Romania , Bucharest became the new nation 's capital city . In 1881 , it became the political centre of the newly proclaimed Kingdom of Romania under King Carol I. During the second half of the 19th century , the city 's population increased dramatically , and a new period of urban development began . During this period , gas lighting , horse - drawn trams , and limited electrification were introduced . The Dâmbovița River was also massively channelled in 1883 , thus putting a stop to previously endemic floods like the 1865 flooding of Bucharest . The Fortifications of Bucharest were built . The extravagant architecture and cosmopolitan high culture of this period won Bucharest the nickname of `` Little Paris '' ( Micul Paris ) of the east , with Calea Victoriei as its Champs - Élysées . I.C. Brătianu Boulevard in the 1930s Between 6 December 1916 and November 1918 , the city was occupied by German forces as a result of the Battle of Bucharest , with the official capital temporarily moved to Iași , in the Moldavia region .

In the period between the two World Wars , the city 's elegant architecture and the sophistication of its elite earned Bucharest the nickname of `` Little Paris '' ( Micul Paris ) . Although buildings and districts in the historic city centre were heavily damaged or destroyed by war , earthquakes , and above all Nicolae Ceaușescu 's program of systematization , many survived . In recent years , the city has been experiencing an economic and cultural boom . In 2016 , the historical city centre was listed as `` endangered '' by the World Monuments Watch . According to the 2011 census , 1,883,425 inhabitants live within the city limits , a decrease from the 2002 census . Adding the satellite towns around the urban area , the proposed metropolitan area of Bucharest would have a population of 2.27 million people . According to Eurostat , Bucharest has a functional urban area of 2,412,530 residents ( as of 2015 ) .
