You learned how to detect building energy inefficiencies by using individual metrics as well as how to use k-means to combine building metrics. You learned the difference between visualizing the results by using a scatter plot and a confusion matrix. In addition, you learned how to create an interactive dashboard in RStudio to interact with and share analysis results. "
