    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of visual analytics tools that help you measure and understand user journeys within the dialog logic of your Watson Assistant system, discover where user abandonments take place, and reason about possible sources of issues. The visual interface can also help to better understand how users interact with different elements of the dialog flow, and gain more confidence in making changes to it. The source of information is your Watson Assistant skill definitions and conversation logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in <a href=\"https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-improve-recommendations-notebook/raw/master/notebook/IBM%20Watson%20Assistant%20Continuous%20Improvement%20Best%20Practices.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Watson Assistant Continuous Improvement Best Practices</a>, you can use this notebook to measure and understand in detail the behavior of users in areas that are not performing well, e.g. having low **Task Completion Rates**.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    ">**Task Completion Rate** - is the percentage of user journeys within key tasks/flows of your virtual assistant that reach a successful resolution. This metric is one of the metrics you can use to measure the **Effectiveness** of your assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Prerequisites \n",
    "This notebook assumes some familiarity with the Watson Assistant dialog programming model, such as skills (formerly workspaces), and dialog nodes. Some familiarity with Python is recommended. This notebook runs on Python.\n"
