These added costs are used instead of the strict inequality constraints in the optimization. In practice, this relaxed problem can often be solved more easily than the original problem.\n\nFor more information, see the following Wikipedia articles: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_assignment_problem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Generalized assignment problem</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_relaxation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lagrangian relaxation</a>.\n\nThis notebook first solves the standard problem (which is not important here), then shows you how to reformulate it to meet the Lagrangian Relaxation features."}, {"metadata": {"render": true}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## How decision optimization can help\n\nPrescriptive analytics (decision optimization) technology recommends actions that are based on desired outcomes. It considers specific scenarios, resources, and knowledge of past and current events. With this insight, your organization can make better decisions and have greater control over business outcomes.\n\nPrescriptive analytics is the next step on the path to insight-based actions. It creates value through synergy with predictive analytics, which analyzes data to predict future outcomes. Prescriptive analytics takes that insight to the next level by suggesting the optimal way to handle a future situation. Organizations that act fast in dynamic conditions and make superior decisions in uncertain environments gain a strong competitive advantage.\n\nWith prescriptive analytics, you can:\n\n* Automate the complex decisions and trade-offs to better manage your limited resources.\n    \n* Take advantage of a future opportunity or mitigate a future risk.\n    \n* Proactively update recommendations based on changing events.\n    \n* Meet operational goals, increase customer loyalty, prevent threats and fraud, and optimize business processes.\n\n\n\n"}, {"metadata": {"render": true}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Use Decision Optimization\nPerform the following steps to create and solve the model.\n\n1.
