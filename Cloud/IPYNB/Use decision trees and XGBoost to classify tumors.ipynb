    "\n",
    "You use an algorithm (code) to create a model (mathematical function). The algorithm tries to find patterns in a sample of **training data** that can be used on future data. The model itself is a summary of these patterns, distilled into mathematical relationships between variables. The algorithm depends on **hyperparameters** that control how it looks for these patterns (that is, how it learns). \n",
    "\n",
    "The difficult part is to find parameters that balance accuracy and precision of the model with its ability to generalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "* Accuracy and precision of predictions depend on the complexity of the model\n",
    "* Ability to generalize depends on how conservative the model is (how quickly it concludes that something is a pattern)\n",
    "\n",
    "This balancing act is called the **bias-variance tradeoff**, because a very complex model will represent all the specific nuances of its training data, therefore failing to generalize. In the opposite case, a simple model does not pick up enough of a pattern to ensure accuracy and precision of future predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your job* is to pick an efficient algorithm and suitable model for our data set and learning task, and fine-tune its parameters to produce a balanced model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**apart from the arduous task of data pre-processing, which this notebook skims over for the sake of brevity (and sanity!)*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Defining the task<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"bullet-3\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to use an augmented version <a href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this data set</a> to develop a predictive model which classifies breast tumors as malignant or benign depending on measurements of the tumor cells. The <a href=\"https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/exchange/public/entry/view/c173693bf48aeb22e41bbe2b41d79c1f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">augmented data set</a> includes statistical analysis values, such as the mean, for some of the measurements. In machine learning terms, the **target** (what you want to predict) is the diagnosis, and the **features** are the measurements. The data sample contains **observations** of tumor cases described by these two components.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 How does an algorithm learn?<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"bullet-4\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize the algorithm to produce a default model, and give it the feature data. The algorithm makes its first set of predictions (close to a random guess).\n",
    "2. The algorithm measures the error between its previous prediction and the true value of the targets. \n",
    "3. The algorithm adjusts its model-building to make the error smaller. Each adjustment represents a part of the pattern it is learning, and is used to process future data.\n",
    "4. It continues to predict, calculate error, and adjust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the algorithm is only using a training sample to perform step 3. If the algorithm makes an adjustment so that its predictions are *exactly* the targets, then it is **overfitted** to the training data. This means that it has lost the ability to generalize to new (unseen) observations, because it picked up a pattern that only applies to the data points it learned from.\n",
