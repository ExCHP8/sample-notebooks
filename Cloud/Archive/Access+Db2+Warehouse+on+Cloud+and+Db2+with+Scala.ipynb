    "# Connect to Db2 Warehouse on Cloud and Db2 using Scala\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to access Db2 Warehouse on Cloud (or a Db2 database) using Scala by following the steps below:\n",
    "1. Import the JDBC library\n",
    "1. Identify and enter the database connection credentials\n",
    "1. Create the database connection\n",
    "1. Query the data\n",
    "1. Close the database connection\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Db2 Warehouse on Cloud ?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Db2 Warehouse on Cloud** is a fully-managed, enterprise-class, cloud data warehouse service, purpose-built for analytics. It offers massively parallel processing (MPP) scale, and compatibility with a wide range of business intelligence (BI) tools.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[Get your own Db2 Warehouse on Cloud free of charge.](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/dashdb)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import the JDBC library\n",
    "Scala code gets compiled into byte code that runs on a Java™ virtual machine (JVM), which allows Scala applications to directly call Java libraries. Therefore, accessing Db2 Warehouse on Cloud from a Scala application is simply a matter of using the existing JDBC driver for Db2: the IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ."
