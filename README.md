Sample notebooks that are published by IBM for IBM Watson Studio.

## Publishing new notebooks

If you are an author seeking to publish a new notebook for WS, please send out the following to @Ashley-Zhao on Slack, Git, or email <Ashley.Zhao@ibm.com>:

1) Legal checklist for each notebook

[Watson Studio Legal Checklist - notebook_tutorial (updt May 30,2018).docx](https://github.ibm.com/dap/dsx-documentation-source/files/622125/Watson.Studio.Legal.Checklist.-.notebook_tutorial.updt.May.30.2018.docx)

2) A copy of your manager's approval for the notebook (i.e. an email with a simple "I approve").

3) If there are on-IBM approved datasets used, data usage request form:

[IBM Data Use Request Form_Final_4-11_fillable.pdf](https://github.ibm.com/dap/dsx-documentation-source/files/622126/IBM.Data.Use.Request.Form_Final_4-11_fillable.pdf)

## No legal review required

Legal review is not required if:

- Making very minor updates to an existing notebook that does not contain a huge content overhaul or new datasets.
- Publishing an existing asset released under the Apache License.
- Using a dataset from the gallery (although a checklist is still needed for any notebooks).

## Removing an asset

Contact @Ashley-Zhao and feel free to make known how many links refer to the asset you had in the docs so they can be removed once they become invalid.
